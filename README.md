Note: the code uses the "train.csv" as the full data because the "test.csv" doesn't include the labels (price) column , so I only used the "train.csv" data in order to be able to see the results of the used models in the code , but when uploading to Kaggle I was using the full data for training and testing its performance by uploading the results to Kaggle.
